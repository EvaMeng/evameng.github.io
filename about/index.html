		Hi there, this is Yi Meng.
		Attending as a graduate student in statistics program at UC Davis, I am more confident about 
		the statistical analysis in R and Python. This program provides me both rigorous theoretical
		knowledge and practical problems in data analysis. Such as, a brief analysis on determinants 
		of plasma beta-carotene levels, the research on the qualifications for data analyst in California 
		and some projects about time series. Please find more information under Research.
