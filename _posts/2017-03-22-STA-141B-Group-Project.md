In this winter quarter, I have taken STA 141B to learn Python. Learning programming language is different than other regular lecture classes. In this class, we are motivated to explore Python by learning the online lectures, solving lab and assignmentâ€™ questions and making a group project. Our group project is about analyzing the qualifications for the data analyst in California. Please find more detailed analysis about the project [here](http://aoran1102.github.io/141B_group_project/).
